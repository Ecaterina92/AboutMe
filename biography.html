                    <p>I was born in Chisinau, Republic of Moldova on 29th of June, 1992. Both my parents, Vasile and Anisia, were born in villages and later on moved in Chisinau as many young people from MSSR in '70-'80s. I have a brother born in 1990 called Alexander. I had attended the lyceum "George Calinescu". Later on, in 2011 I have applied to State University of Moldova, the department of History and Philosophy. I have a license's and master's degree in Human Sciences. For 3 years I have worked at The Academy of Sciences of Moldova, in the Cultural Heritage Institute. I married in 2017. My husband is called Denis, he is 2 years senior than  me. He is an engineer. In 2019 on 27th of February our daughter Diana was born. Currently I am on a maternity leave and try to find myself in another career.</p>
